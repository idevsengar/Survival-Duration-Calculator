## Project Description
The Survival Duration Calculator is a simple Python program that calculates how long a person has lived in various time units, such as months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Features
- Accepts age in years as input.
- Allows the user to choose from six different time units for calculation.
- Includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.

## Thought Process
1. Simplify the problem into manageable steps.
2. Use functions to make the code reusable and modular.
3. Handle edge cases, such as invalid inputs and negative age.
